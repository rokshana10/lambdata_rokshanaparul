review.md: 

## have a test PYPI package 
---> have a setup.py
---> has only 1 "helper" function. (in ds_utilties.py)

## follow layouy / code flow? 
--> yes in good order as done in class
--> readme is a bit sparse? 

## understand the logic/reasoning for what it is doing?
--> yes only 1 function really at play, so not hard to follow along. 

## installing testpypi:
--> could not figure out how to easily install package.
